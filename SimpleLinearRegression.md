# Simple Linear Regression
* Equation of the formula: y = b0 + b1. x1, where:
  * y = dependent variable (DV);
  * x1 = independent variable (IV);
  * IV Coefficient (proportionality between IV and DV);
  * b0 = Constant.
* This formulae represents a slopped/trend line on xy coordinates that shows the relation between the dependent and independent variables;
* Basically visualizes all the information and fits a line the best represents the dataset as a whole;

* The **Constant** means the point at which the line crosses the axis at x=0, or, it is where the line crosses the y-axis.
